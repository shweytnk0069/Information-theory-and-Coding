LZW is an extremely effective lossless compression algorithm that can be used in tandem with various other methods to increase efficiency, security and size. We aim to apply this method to existing practices and make them better. In this paper, we will use LZW along with steganography to hide data in an image. A drawback of steganography is that the data that can be hidden in an image is less, and we will solve this issue by compressing the data using LZW first and then hiding this data in the image. This method hence gives us the possibility of storing much more data with much more security. Since compress is lossless, we can faithfully recreate data. We use 24 bit BMP as the carrier file, and we chose LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm to hide our message in pixel colors. We take a sample text that we then encrypt into our image, and calculate its efficiency using different metrics.The encryption and decryption methods used in this method increase security and the amount of data that can be inserted in an image, hence we recommend using it
